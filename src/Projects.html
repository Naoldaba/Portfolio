                            <p><span>Abronet.org</span> is a specific Fintech platform that
                                aims to modernize and digitize the traditional
                                Equb concept, providing a digital platform for
                                individuals to participate in similar group
                                savings and lending activities.
                            </p>
                            <p>An Equb, also known as an Iqub or Hundi,
                                is a traditional rotating savings and
                                credit association found in various cultures
                                around the world. In an Equb, a group of
                                individuals contribute a fixed amount of
                                money at regular intervals (e.g., weekly
                                or monthly).
                            </p>
                            <p>The total sum is then given
                                to one member of the group in a cycle,
                                and this process repeats until all members
                                have received their share. Equbs provide a
                                way for people to save and access capital
                                in communities where formal banking services
                                may be limited.
